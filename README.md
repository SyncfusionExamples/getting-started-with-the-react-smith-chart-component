# Getting Started with the React Smith Chart Component

The [React Smith Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-smith-chart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-smith-chart-github-samples) is a control for showing the parameters of transmission lines in high-frequency circuit applications. A quick start project that shows how to create and configure the Syncfusion React Smith Chart component in a React project. This sample explains how to populate list data, add legends, and enable data labels and tooltips.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download ) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-react-smith-chart-component` repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

### Tooltip
The interactive React Smith chart displays a pop-up with additional information when the mouse is hovered over a data point.

### Legend
A legend provides additional information that is helpful in identifying individual series in a Smith chart. It can be docked at the left, right, top, or bottom positions around the plot area. By clicking a legend item, we can toggle series visibility.

### Axis customization
The React Smith chart control supports a horizontal axis and radial axis. The horizontal axis is used for plotting resistance values of transmission lines and the radial axis is used for plotting nonresistance values of transmission lines.
